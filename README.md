# Vesnea's Obsidian Theme
## Description
It's a theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) based on Seavalanche's Project Sea Web theme colors [Seavalanche Website](https://seavalanche.github.io/projectseaweb/).

## Usage
You can freely use it, modify it, anything.
You can also inform me if something is broken, otherwise I won't update it unless if I feel compelled to.

## Disclaimer
While mainly made for personal use, I want to share it publicly so others can also enjoy the vibe of taking notes with my theme colors.
