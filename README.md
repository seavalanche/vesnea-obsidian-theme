# Vesnea's Obsidian Theme
It's a theme for Obsidian app (a note-taking app) based on Seavalanche's Vesnea theme colors (site: https://seavalanche.github.io/projectseaweb/).

While mainly made for personal use, I want to share it publicly so others can also enjoy the vibe of taking notes with my theme colors.
Screenshots will be updated later.
